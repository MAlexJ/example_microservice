Reliability is crucial in system design, ensuring consistent performance and minimal failures. 
The reliability of a device is considered high if it has repeatedly performed its function with success 
and low if it has tended to fail in repeated trials. 

The reliability of a system is defined as the probability of performing the intended function over 
a given period under specified operating conditions.
